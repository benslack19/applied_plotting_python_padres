# applied_plotting_python_padres
A project associated with the course Applied Plotting, Charting and Data Representation in Python on Coursera.

As part of the course, we were graded on a project of our choice utilizing Python visualization tools. I chose to look at whether increases in Padres spending towards player contracts correlates with team success since 2000. I pulled winning percentages from Wikipedia and salaries from baseballprospectus.com. I then plotted the total spending and winning percentages together and determined the correlation coefficient.
